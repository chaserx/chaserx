### Hi there 👋 I'm Chase

I like to build things especially if they're whimsical. I used to build tools for a [cancer research laboratory](http://www.uky.edu/~mwkilg0/) 👨‍🔬, [open government efforts](http://openlexington.org) 🏛️, and later at some small companies 👨‍💻. I now coach a [team](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/fulfillment/) as they iterate on things at [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) 🦊. I used to see myself as a builder 👷, but I am fascinated by dynamic teams not just software teams, and, therefore, I find myself in management 👨‍💼.

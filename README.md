### Hi there 👋 I'm Chase

I like to build things especially if they're whimsical. I used to build tools for a [cancer research laboratory](http://www.uky.edu/~mwkilg0/) 👨‍🔬, [open government efforts](https://github.com/openlexington) 🏛️, and later at some small companies 👨‍💻. Most recently, I led a [team](https://handbook.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/development/fulfillment/utilization/) at [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) 🦊. I used to see myself only as a builder 👷, but I am fascinated by dynamic teams (not just software teams), and, as such, I find myself in management 👨‍💼.
